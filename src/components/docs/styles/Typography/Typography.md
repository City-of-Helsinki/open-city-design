### Using Typography

City of Helsinki uses bespoke typeface Helsinki Grotesk.

Helsinki Grotesk is lisenced for use on Helsinki web services. Desktop usage (for example with design tools) requires a valid lisence from the user. The lisence can be obtained [from Camelot typefaces webshop](https://camelot-typefaces.com/helsinki-grotesk).

Fallback font when Helsinki Grotesk is not available is Arial.
