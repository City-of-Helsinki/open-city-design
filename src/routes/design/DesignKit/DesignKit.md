#### Using the Design Kit

You can download Sketch resources and use the existing components, modules, and patterns. The Sketch resources include a Sketch Library file which enables you to reuse symbols across projects.

We recommend you read the [Sketch Library documentation](https://sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/) to better understand how the Library feature works.

The file structure is displayed in the example picture below

*`hki-library` file
- contains the component library used for building all other elements in the system

*`resources` folder
- includes `modules` and `patterns` files
