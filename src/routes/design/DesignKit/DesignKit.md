#### Using the Helsinki Design Kit

You can download all Helsnki Sjetch resources and use the existing component, module, pattern -sytem pre build. The Sketch resources also include a Sketch Library extension wich enables you to reuse symbols easily cross projctly.

We recommend you read the Sketch Library documentation to better understand how the Library feature works

The file structure in the Design kit is displayed in the example picure

* `hki-library` file
      - Contains the component library used for building all other elements in the ssytem
* `resources` folder includes
      - `modules` and
      - `patterns` files
