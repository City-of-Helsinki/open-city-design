# Getting started

Open City Design System is organised into components, modules and patterns. 
The components use Bootstrap 4 as a backing framework. 
You can learn more about Bootstrap 4 in their [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).

##### Workflow

The OCDS Development Guide contains styles, components, modules, patterns and page templates for developers.
The OCDS Design Guide is built for those who are interested in designing new components, modules, patterns and page templates. There are multiple ways to begin the design process. At this point we have structured a few Sketch files for you to get you started.

##### What is Open City Design System

Open City Design System is a pattern and UI component library for cities’ services. Components and other UI elements can be combined with city-specific branding. Design and development tools have been combined to make new service creation simpler and easier to approach.

Design system’s goals are:

* To create a collection of reusable UI elements
* To combine UI elements with design tools (including city-specific branding)
* To promote design thinking and open service creation within public services
* To create a community of developers and designers working together for better public services

##### Elements of the design system

Open City Design System is based on components. Components are used to build modules. Components and modules together form patterns. Finally, components, modules and patterns can be used to make page templates.

Design system’s elements are:

* Components
   - Built using Bootstrap 4 library as a basis
   - Basic components like buttons, alerts, badges etc.
* Modules
   - Created from components
   - Modules such as navbar, footer, card etc.
* Patterns
   - Created from components and modules
   - Service patterns such as user interactions, feedback etc.
* Page templates
   - Page templates to get you started: landing page etc.

The project is in early Alpha.
