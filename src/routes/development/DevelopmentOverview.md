# Getting started

Open City Design System is organised into components, modules and patterns. The components use Bootstrap 4 as a backing framework. You can learn more about Bootstrap 4 in their [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/contents/).

##### Workflow

The OCDS Design Guide is built for those who are intrested in designing new comoponents, modules, patterns and page templates for the City of Helsinki. 
There re multiple ways to begin the design process -but we have structured few files and guides for you to begin with.

##### What is Design System

Now â€“we do understand that this can be a bit overwelming to grasp but bare with us. We have build a system that contains all ya need for developing and designing digital services using the Cities own design systems. In other words, we have combined Design tools and Development tools to make new service creation simple and easy to approach.

Design Systems goals are: 

* To establish consistency among digital services
* Ensure usability of Digital Services by including Design in all Service creation stages
* Gathering a community of Developers and Designers to contribute to the overall Desing language

##### Elements of the Design System

The Design system is built on Components. These components are used to build modules that together form Patterns.

Design Systems elements are: 

1. Components
   - Build using Bootstrap 4 component library as a basis
   - Simple components such as Button, Alert, Badge etc.
* Modules
   - Created by using Components
   - Component group that can be Navbar, Footer, Card etc.
 * Patterns
   - Created using Modules
   - Contains a more complex idea of service
   - Pattern can be a Task List, Card Group etc.
